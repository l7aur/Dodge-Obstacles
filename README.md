### Further Developments

- 2d game.
- Resize the window so that 15 files can be displayed on a row and 7 rows are visible.
- Compile and run in terminal.
- Fit both the terminal and the folder window on the screen.
- Select the terminal and use w to move upwards and s to move downwards.
- Dodge obstacles that come to you in a folder window.
- hugely limited by syscall efficiency -> files are intended to be bitmaps, but the time it requires to create them is just a huge bottleneck, thus collision and end prompt were not implemented (I don't think leaving the files as .txt (meaning no visual representation) would make it enjoyable to play even though it would fix the current issue)
